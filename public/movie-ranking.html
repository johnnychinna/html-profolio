<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
<h2>My top Three Movies all the time is </h2>
<hr>
<h3>A Bit of Light</h3>
<p>This is a movie about a woman named Ella, struggling with alcoholism and trying to win back custody of her children.
    The movie focuses on the unusual friendship between Ella and a teenager named Neil, who seems to offer her emotional support. 
    However, the review criticizes the film for:<br>
    Unoriginal filmmaking techniques<br>
    An unrealistic and underdeveloped relationship between Ella and Neil<br>
    Ignoring potentially interesting dynamics between Ella and her father or her ex-husband and his new wife<br>
    Overall, the review suggests that "A Bit of Light" relies on melodrama instead of exploring the complexities of Ella's situation.</p>
<h3>Arthur the King</h3>
<p>It is really three movies in one, all watchable, but the pieces do not always mesh.  The first and least compelling piece is Michael’s story. He is a restless character, possibly an adrenalin junkie, or just someone with something to prove after being called “the best adventure team racer never to win a championship” by “Man vs. Wild” host Bear Grylls (playing himself off camera). Michael loves his wife and daughter but he does not love working for his former military-turned realtor father. He will not let his legacy be a viral image of his losing team literally stuck in the mud.

<h3>Damsel</h3>
<p>You might prefer this film's close cousin, "The Princess," where the title character goes full "Die Hard" against villains occupying her family's castle. That one hits the ground running and never lets up, except for periodic flashbacks to how she learned to fight like that and her father's issues with it.</p>
